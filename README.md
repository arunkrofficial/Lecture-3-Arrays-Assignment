# Algorithm Practice

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems implemented in JavaScript. Each problem is accompanied by a JavaScript solution along with an explanation. Below is a list of the problems and their corresponding solutions:

## Problem 1: Find Three Integers Closest to Target

- File: `findClosestSum.js`
- Description: Given an integer array `nums` and a target value, find three integers in `nums` such that their sum is closest to the target. Returns the sum of the three integers.
- Example: `findClosestSum([-1, 2, 1, -4], 1)` should return `2`

## Problem 2: Find Unique Quadruplets Summing to Target

- File: `findUniqueQuadruplets.js`
- Description: Given an array `nums` of integers and a target value, find all unique quadruplets in `nums` that sum up to the target. Returns an array of quadruplets.
- Example: `findUniqueQuadruplets([1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], 0)` should return `[[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0, 1]]`

## Problem 3: Next Permutation

- File: `nextPermutation.js`
- Description: Given an array `nums` representing an integer, find the next lexicographically greater permutation of the elements in `nums`. Returns the modified array.
- Example: `nextPermutation([1, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 3, 2]`

## Problem 4: Search Insert Position

- File: `searchInsert.js`
- Description: Given a sorted array `nums` and a target value, find the index where the target should be inserted in order. Returns the index.
- Example: `searchInsert([1, 3, 5, 6], 5)` should return `2`

## Problem 5: Increment Large Integer

- File: `incrementLargeInteger.js`
- Description: Given an array `digits` representing a large integer, increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
- Example: `incrementLargeInteger([1, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 2, 4]`

## Problem 6: Find Single Number

- File: `findSingleNumber.js`
- Description: Given an array `nums` where every element appears twice except for one, find the single number. Returns the single number.
- Example: `findSingleNumber([2, 2, 1])` should return `1`

## Problem 7: Find Missing Ranges

- File: `findMissingRanges.js`
- Description: Given a range [lower, upper] and a sorted integer array `nums`, find the shortest sorted list of ranges that exactly covers all the missing numbers. Returns the list of ranges.
- Example: `findMissingRanges([0, 1, 3, 50, 75], 0, 99)` should return `[[2, 2], [4, 49], [51, 74], [76, 99]]`

## Problem 8: Can Attend Meetings

- File: `canAttendMeetings.js`
- Description: Given an array of meeting time intervals, determine if a person could attend all the meetings. Returns a boolean value.
- Example: `canAttendMeetings([[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]])` should return `false`
